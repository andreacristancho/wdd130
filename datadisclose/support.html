          SHARE MY DATA Is it an installable program?
          No, it is a web site that can be accessed from any mobile device.

          SHARE MY DATA requires knowledge of systems and computing by users to access the information?
          No, anyone with basic knowledge of internet access can use it.

          If I have the information in my information systems but I want to present it in a more friendly way, can I receive help?
          We can help you create more visual and attractive Business Intelligence reports.

          Every time I want to update information to display, should I contact the provider?

          You have 3 weekly hours of virtual support for a month, after completion of the training stage. After this, you can request hours of training according to your need, with the respective payment.
