    <h2>Andrea Cristancho</h2>
    <p>
      I live in Bogot√°, Colombia, South America. I am married and have 3
      children ages 23, 21 and 13 years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am an Industrial Engineer. I am enrolled in Applied Technology and I am
      looking for a Computer and Web Programming certificate, then I hope to
      finish the Database Certificate. BYU is a great option to update and train
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am reorienting my professional approach with basic knowledge in data
      analytics and my desire is to be able to implement solutions based on
      machine learning and to be able to display the visualizations of these
      analytical models through web pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been part of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for 18
      years and throughout this time I have received beautiful blessings based
      on my obedience.
